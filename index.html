						<p>I’ve been working as a digital marketer in the B2B investment management industry for over a decade, and don’t think marketing teams have been doing a particularly great job.</p>
						<p>While this lacklustre performance is at least partly due to some wider issues in the modern office &ndash; which mostly boil down to an inability to focus due to smartphones, overflowing inboxes, and back-to-back meetings &ndash; there is also a less obvious reason: digital marketing teams haven’t adapted their approach (when they have one) to the peculiarities of the B2B investment management industry, and have therefore been repeatedly trying to fit the proverbial square peg into a round hole.</p>
						
						<p>This guide aims to help digital marketing teams serve their firms more effectively by demonstrating how a popular marketing methodology, <strong>inbound marketing</strong>, can be adapted to properly fit the industry.</p>
						
						<h2 id="what-is-inbound-marketing" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">What is inbound marketing?</h2>		

						<p>Inbound marketing is a methodology used to build more authentic and durable relationships with a firm’s audience through a patient and subtle approach, rather than simply interrupting them with generic advertising or unsolicited emails &ndash; which seems especially well-suited to the world of investments, in which a long-term and patient attitude is also typically required in order to achieve success.</p>
						<p>From the perspective of the business implementing it, inbound marketing consists of three stages: <strong>attract</strong>, <strong>engage</strong>, and <strong>delight</strong>. The first aims to attract members of the firm’s target audience, the second to engage and convert them into customers, and the third to provide exceptional post-sale customer service. The overall goal for marketing is to deliver the right content, to the right people, at the right time.</p>
						
						<p>As an example, a business that sells software to other businesses could try an inbound marketing approach by following these broad steps:</p>

						<ol>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Attract</strong>: publish valuable content to attract members of the firm’s target audience from search engines and social media.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Engage</strong>: allow website visitors to submit their contact details to subscribe to the firm’s blog, and send emails to subscribers about the topics they express an interest in.</li>
							<li><strong>Delight</strong>: send customers a welcome email upon purchase, a series of helpful tips about the product, and encourage them to upgrade and/or purchase add-ons where appropriate.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>Importantly, to implement inbound marketing, the marketing team must be able to identify the current stage of each contact &ndash; attract, engage, or delight &ndash; so their experience can be personalised accordingly.</p>

						<p>For businesses operating outside the investment management industry &ndash; such as a software firm &ndash; this should be relatively simple: a data point can be added to each record in the firm’s <strong>marketing database</strong> (in which details of all mailable contacts are stored) to note if a contact, or the firm they work for, owns the product. It could be set to a Boolean value (“yes/no”) or describe which specific version of the product is owned (if basic and premium versions are available, for example). Once created, it could then be set up to update automatically upon purchase, or even updated manually if automation isn’t possible.</p>

						<p>Once the data point has been set up, contacts in the firm’s marketing database can then be segmented and marketed to accordingly: leads who haven’t yet become customers can continue to be emailed blogs and case studies of interest, recent purchasers can be sent an automatic welcome email, and those who have purchased the basic product can be enticed to upgrade to the premium version. Lists of applicable contacts can be compiled for future marketing campaigns by filtering the marketing database by this new data point.</p>
						
						<h2 id="why-should-inbound-marketing-be-adapted-for-investment managers" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Why should inbound marketing be adapted for investment managers?</h2>				
						
						<p>For investment managers that sell their products directly to retail investors (D2C) – purchased through the firm's website – adding a data point to identify if a contact is invested in any of the firm’s products may be feasible, albeit with additional complexity: as investment managers tend to offer multiple products (versus, say, a single software offering) a separate data point will be required for each product offered.</p>

						<p>And due to the fact that investments can be bought and sold frequently by investors (unlike software), some form of automation would probably also be needed to keep each data point up-to-date.</p>

						<h3>Lack of transaction and holdings data</h3>

						<p>The investment products of <strong>business-to-business (B2B)</strong> investment managers aren’t bought and sold through the firm’s website. Instead, salespeople develop relationships with – and try to win business from – investment professionals at other organisations (such as financial advisors, fund selectors, or research analysts) who are able to allocate money, either directly or indirectly, into the firm’s products.</p>

						<p>Any trades in and out of a B2B investment manager’s products are handled by the firm’s salespeople, or conducted entirely through third-party investment platforms, so it’s highly unlikely that transaction and holdings data will be available to the marketing team.</p>

						<p>This lack of available data means that the aforementioned data points can’t be used by the marketing team to identify which contacts are invested in the firm’s products (i.e., those who would sit in the delight stage). Put simply, the marketing team don’t know who their “customers” are.</p>
						
						<h2 id="marketing-issues" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Marketing issues</h2>						
										
						<p>One of the main reasons for writing this guide was to help combat several issues (which I noticed at every marketing team I worked for):</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Lack of industry knowledge</strong>. Marketers tend to have a very poor understanding of even the basics of investment management. In many cases, they have no idea about what their firm does or who their target audience is.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Lack of digital marketing knowledge</strong>. In addition to a poor level of technical skill (such as coding), there is an important lack of basic common sense around how digital marketing works. This deficiency make marketers insecure, keen to impress, and uncomfortable with simplicity &mdash; so they buy impressive-sounding and expensive software with no understanding of how it works, how it will be maintained, or how the huge amounts of data they can generate will be used. Additionally, multiple agencies are often paid large sums of money to perform basic tasks that should be done internally.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>No direction or strategy</strong>. Marketers rarely have any long-term strategy in place and are constantly distracted by a mishmash of unfocused projects and tasks, often started prematurely. Additionally, each poorly-completed or abandoned project adds more mess and unnecessary complexity to existing systems, data, and processes.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Poor time management</strong>. There is a growing trend, in the digital age, of being constantly busy. A culture of back-to-back meetings, overflowing email inboxes, and cluttered desktops stifles independent thought and ability to effect change.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Some examples of how these issues can play out in the real world include:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-3">At one firm I joined, the marketing team boasted that they had a <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake" target="_blank">data lake</a>. I was shocked &mdash; they could barely upload a PDF to the website. However, it soon became clear that it wasn't actually used for anything, was only updated via an occasional manual spreadsheet upload, and was costing the firm a small fortune.</li>
							<li class="mb-3">I was once asked to collect registrants of a third-party webinar as leads, which would have to be manually uploaded to the marketing automation system. At that point, however, we didn't collect leads ourselves, or have a process to assign them to a salesperson &mdash; so they would just sit in our database, untouched.</li>
							<li class="mb-3">At another firm, the marketing team sent an email to prospects about a report they had produced (I forget what the report was about). The email directed recipients to a landing page which required them to submit their personal details in a form to download the report &mdash; even though they were already in the firm's database.</li>
						</ul>
												
						<p>Capable and enthusiastic marketers can quickly end up frustrated, disillusioned and demotivated &mdash; in an industry where the value of marketing is already being questioned.</p>
												
						<h2 id="a-potential-solution" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">A potential solution</h2>
						
						<p>This guide suggests a method for creating and implementing a digital marketing strategy for a B2B investment manager, with some important characteristics:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Built step-by-step</strong>. Rather than jumping from project to project, the strategy is built up through a series of steps, and each step is only started once the previous step has been fully completed. Once built, any future projects should be "bolted on" to the framework as much as possible.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Focus on simplicity</strong>. Unnecessary complexity, external marketing agencies, and expensive software will be avoided (you will discover that you can do much more with less). Additional complexity or costs will only be added if they make sense, and only once the basics are in place. </li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Properly prepared.</strong> We will perform important research on key aspects of our firm &mdash; what it does, products it offers, and its target audience &mdash; before jumping into the implementation of the strategy.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Organic focus</strong>. Organic and free digital channels &mdash; such as organic search, email, and social media &mdash; will be prioritised over paid advertising.</li>
						</ul>		
												
						<p>I believe that implementing the strategy will lead to positive outcomes for your firm: happier colleagues, better relations between marketing and sales teams, and an improved reputation with clients and prospects. And by eliminating a lot of agency, advertising, and software costs, it can also significantly reduce marketing spend &mdash; with any cost savings ideally passed on to the firm's clients through lower product fees.</p>

						<h2 id="challenges" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Challenges</h2>		

						<p>Implementing the strategy won't be easy &mdash; especially if you are a new hire. Any systems and processes you inherit will likely have flaws that have built up over the years, and colleagues will want to operate the same way they always have (which usually means haphazardly starting and abandoning projects and tasks). You can quickly become consumed by it all &mdash; and then nothing changes.</p>
						
						<p>After struggling with these same challenges across several jobs, which occured over a couple of years following the COVID pandemic, I realised that to break the cycle I would need to present a long-term plan to my next boss that would be unaffected by the short-term whims of colleagues. I figured that if my manager was convinced of its potential benefits, they could help pause some of the distractions and give me the necessary space to put the long-term plan in place. Hopefully, you can use the guide in a similar way.</p>
						
						<h2 id="lewisham-asset-management" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lewisham Asset Management</h2>		
						
						<p>To be able to explain and demonstrate various concepts and examples throughout the guide, I will use a fictional B2B investment management firm, called <strong>Lewisham Asset Management</strong> (or "Lewisham" for short).</p>
											
						<h2 id="who-is-this-guide-for" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Who is this guide for?</h2>
						
						<p>This guide is primarily aimed at digital marketing professionals who work at B2B investment managers, but could also be of interest to members of the wider marketing team, students, and professionals in similar industries.</p>
						
						<h2 id="what-tools-and-software-are-required" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">What tools and software are required?</h2>
						
						<p>To implement the strategy, you will need a website &mdash; with the ability to publish content &mdash; and tools for <a class="external" href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-marketing-automation" target="_blank">marketing automation</a>, <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank">customer relationship management (CRM)</a> and online document storage.</p>
						
						<p>Within the guide, I use <a class="external" href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/b2b-marketing-automation/" target="_blank">Pardot</a> for marketing automation (renamed <strong>Marketing Cloud Account Engagement</strong> in April 2022) and the <a class="external" href="https://www.salesforce.com/crm/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> CRM system. Other systems will work differently, but the basic principles are the same.</p>
