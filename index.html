						<p>After more than a decade working in digital marketing within the B2B investment management industry, I’ve seen first-hand how marketing teams could play a far greater role in their firm’s success.</p>

						<p>Part of the underperformance stems from well-known modern workplace challenges &mdash; the constant pull of smartphones, nonstop emails, and back-to-back meetings that disrupt deep work. But there’s a more fundamental issue: digital marketing teams haven’t tailored their approach (when they have one) to the peculiarities of B2B investment management. Instead, they continue trying to apply generic models that simply don’t fit.</p>

						<p>This guide offers a practical solution by showing how a widely used methodology &mdash; <strong>inbound marketing</strong> &mdash; can be adapted to suit the realities of the industry.</p>
						
						<h2 id="what-is-inbound-marketing" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">What is inbound marketing?</h2>	
						
						<p>Inbound marketing is a strategy focused on building trust and long-term relationships with the firm’s audience through valuable, non-intrusive content. Rather than relying on unsolicited emails or ads, it aims to deliver content that aligns with an audience member’s interests, at the appropriate time.</p>

						<p>Inbound marketing typically consists of three stages:</p>

						<ol>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Attract</strong> &mdash; publishing content that draws the right audience via search engines and social media.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Engage</strong> &mdash; encouraging visitors to subscribe and receive tailored communications.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Delight</strong> &mdash; supporting customers after purchase to foster loyalty and advocacy.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>In practice, this requires knowing where each contact sits in their journey so that marketing efforts can be personalised appropriately.</p>

						<p>For most industries, this is manageable. A software company, for example, can mark contacts in its marketing database to reflect whether they own the product, and if so, which version. Based on this information, campaigns can then be tailored as needed: prospects receive thought leadership, new customers get onboarding emails, and users of basic versions are offered upgrades.</p>
						
						<h2 id="why-inbound-marketing-needs-adapting-for-investment-managers" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Why inbound marketing needs adapting for investment managers </h2>				

						<p>For direct-to-consumer (D2C) investment firms, segmenting contacts based on product ownership is technically possible. However, the complexity increases with the number of products offered and the fluid nature of investments, which are regularly bought and sold. Reliable automation would be essential to keep such data current.</p>

						<p>However, it gets even more complicated &mdash; and often impossible &mdash; for B2B investment managers. Here's why:</p>
						
						<h3 id="lack-of-transaction-and-holdings-data" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lack of transaction and holdings data</h3>

						<p>Investment products aren’t purchased on a B2B firm’s website. Sales happen through personal relationships between salespeople and professional allocators &mdash; such as financial advisors or consultants &mdash; or via third-party platforms. This means marketing teams don’t have access to reliable holdings data.</p>

						<p>Even when internal data exists, it’s often fragmented, out of sync with marketing systems, or only available at a firm level, offering little relevance to individual contacts. In short, marketing typically has no way to know who the firm’s clients are.</p>
						
						<h3 id="accounting-for-gatekeepers" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Accounting for gatekeepers</h3>	

						<p>Further complicating things, B2B investment managers work not only with investors but also with <em>gatekeepers</em> &mdash; individuals who recommend products to others without directly investing themselves.</p>

						<p>Examples include:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Fund selectors</strong> at wealth managers who curate product lists for use by their firm’s client-facing advisors.</li>
							<li><strong>Manager research analysts</strong> at consultancies who recommend strategies used by institutional clients.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Gatekeepers often behave like investors &mdash; researching products and engaging with content &mdash; yet they would be wrongly excluded if communications were based solely on investment ownership.</p>

						<h3 id="lack-of-sub-segment-specific-content" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lack of sub-segment-specific content</h3>
						
						<p>Even if accurate investor data were available and gatekeepers could be identified, segmentation based on ownership still wouldn’t make much sense.</p>
						
						<p>Investment products are intangible. Beyond a report of an individual user's account balance (available only to direct clients), there’s nothing that differentiates the experience of an investor from someone simply researching.</p>
						
						<p>Moreover, most content investment firms produce &mdash; factsheets, commentaries, webinars &mdash; is equally relevant to prospects and existing investors. That’s because most investors share a common goal of long-term growth, and an investment product’s value proposition is usually demonstrated through data and analysis, not through usage or experience. This reduces the need for case studies, testimonials, or demos that are common in other industries.</p>
						
						<p>Even macroeconomic content, like views on interest rates or inflation, can simultaneously influence new investment decisions and reassure current holders.</p>
						
						<p>In short, segmenting by ownership ultimately doesn’t change what content is sent.</p>
						
						<h2 id="adapting-the-inbound-marketing-approach-for-investment-managers" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Adapting the inbound marketing approach for investment managers</h2>
						
						<p>Given that the 'delight' stage can’t be applied effectively, inbound marketing must be simplified to two core stages:</p>

						<ul>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Attract</strong> &mdash; drawing in new audiences via valuable, discoverable content.</li>
							<li class="mb-2"><strong>Engage</strong> &mdash; providing tailored communication to known contacts based on their stated interests.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>To make this work, two important changes are required.</p>

						
						<p>New audiences will be attracted as usual &mdash; by publishing content the firm's target audience finds valuable, ensuring it is discoverable on search engines, and distributing it on social media.</p> 
						
						<p>When engaging with the contacts who have become part of the firm's marketing database, however, some changes will need to be made to account for the various complexities that have been highlighted.</p>
						
						<h3 id="segmenting-the-marketing-database" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Segmenting the marketing database</h3>
						
						<p>The first change applies to how contacts are segmented. As a contact's status as an investor in the firm's products won't be stored on their record, they won't be segmented on this status; instead, contacts will be segmented primarily on their interests &mdash; which they explicitly express via <strong>website subscriptions</strong> &mdash; for marketing purposes.</p>
						
						<p>Website visitors will be able to subscribe to areas of interest among the options offered by the investment manager &mdash; such as topics, investment strategies, products, and so on &mdash; by submitting a website form (which includes their contact details). From this point, the contact will be added to the marketing database, segmented accordingly, and sent any content that aligns with their individual preferences. Contacts will be able to change their preferences, or unsubscribe entirely, at any time.</p>
						
						<p>Segmenting the firm's audience based on this <strong>explicit data</strong> about their interests &mdash; which can only be provided by the contacts themselves &mdash; and limiting any communications to the preferences they set is a key part of the inbound marketing approach, and aligns well with the principles of data protection regulations (such as <strong>GDPR</strong>).</p>
						
						<h3 id="using-implicit-data-about-digital-activity" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Using implicit data about digital activity</h3>
						
						<p>The second change applies to how <strong>implicit data</strong> about a contact's digital activity &mdash; collected by the marketing automation system without the contact's input, but only if they give consent &mdash; is used.</p>
						
						<p>Collecting this type of data is possible because when website visitors subscribe (and consent) the marketing automation system sets a cookie on their browser to track any future digital activity &mdash; website visits, engagement with emails, document downloads, and so on &mdash; which is logged on their respective contact record in the marketing database.</p>
						
						<p>As you can imagine, the ability to observe the behaviour of members of the firm's audience &mdash; at an <em>individual level</em> &mdash; is incredibly powerful: it offers the potential for marketing activity to be individually personalised for each contact based on their digital activity (assuming that they have explicitly expressed an interest in receiving any communications that are sent as a result).</p>
						
						<p>Unfortunately, as highlighted, marketing teams at B2B investment managers are limited in two key areas &mdash; an inability to segment audiences based on their stage in the customer journey, and a lack of content aimed at specific sub-segments of the firm’s audience &mdash; which renders implicit data almost useless for tailoring marketing activity.</p>
						
						<p>However, it is incredibly useful information which will still be put to use by being passed on to the firm's salespeople, helping them to nurture relationships with their clients and prospects. Unlike the marketing team, salespeople will have detailed knowledge about the individual circumstances of each of their assigned contacts (such as their stage in the sales process), due to spending most of their working day in direct communication with them offline &mdash; via meetings, dinners, phone calls, and so on &mdash; and storing notes about any communications in the customer relationship management (CRM) system.</p>
						
						<p>Therefore, the digital activity of tracked contacts will be reported to their assigned salesperson via <strong>email alerts</strong>, set up to be sent automatically by the marketing automation system &mdash; either in real-time, or as some kind of periodic summary (e.g., a daily notification of a salesperson's assigned contacts with digital activity in the previous 24 hours).</p>
						
						<p>When alerted to digital activity of an assigned contact, a salesperson will be able to reconcile it with any direct communications they may have had. In cases where the observed activity was a result of these communications, they can simply consider the alert as "nice to know" information. But in the cases where it wasn't, opportunities will arise to reach out to engaged contacts for an introduction, catch-up, or to reignite a relationship that might have become stale (although they must use subtlety when doing so).</p>
						
						<p>Sending implicit data about the digital activity of tracked contacts to the sales team, in place of using it to influence marketing activity, marks a general shift in the primary focus for the marketing team in the adapted approach: it now becomes the provision of support to salespeople to help them nurture their relationships with clients and prospects.</p>
						
						<p>This support &mdash; which will involve sourcing new leads, sending alerts about the digital activity of tracked contacts, and providing content and materials &mdash; is a much better fit for an industry in which most of the sales process happens offline, visits to the website are short, and salespeople are ultimately responsible for winning business.</p>
