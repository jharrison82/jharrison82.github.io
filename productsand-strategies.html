						<p>In this chapter, we will research and document the range of <strong>investment strategies</strong>, associated <strong>investment vehicles</strong>, and other <strong>services</strong> that the firm offers.<p>
						
						<h2 id="investment-strategies" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Investment strategies</h2>	
						
						<p>An investment strategy is simply an approach to investing in some area of the financial markets. Once an area of focus is chosen &mdash; such as the global stock markets, U.S. stock market, or European bond market &mdash; an appropriate <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp" target="_blank">market index</a> is selected, which makes up the universe of available investments for the strategy.</p>
						
						<p>For example, a investment management firm may decide to create a global equity strategy that focuses on investing in stock markets around the world. From the range of available market indices, they could choose the <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/msci-acwi.asp" target="_blank">MSCI All Country World Index</a> (ACWI) &mdash; a global stock market index that contains nearly 3,000 companies from around the world &mdash; as the investment universe for the strategy.</p>
						
						<p>The five largest stock holdings in the ACWI, which are weighted by the company's <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp" target="_blank">market capitalisation</a>, are shown in figure 1.</p>

						<p>Next comes an important distinction: whether the strategy is <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activeinvesting.asp" target="_blank">active</a> or <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveinvesting.asp" target="_blank">passive</a>.</p>
						
						<h3 id="passive-investment-strategies" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Passive investment strategies</h3>	
						
						<p>A <strong>passive strategy</strong> simply aims to replicate the portfolio of investments in the appropriate market index. If the global equity strategy from the previous example was created as a passive strategy, it would hold the same companies as the ACWI, in exactly the same weights &mdash; or as closely as is practical (the smallest weighted holdings are sometimes excluded from strategies that replicate an index with a large number of total holdings).</p>
						
						<p>Importantly, market indexes are theoretical: they can't be invested in directly. Creating a passive strategy is a first step in making an index available for actual investment (the second is to launch an associated <a href="#investment-vehicles">investment vehicle</a>, which we will cover shortly).</p>

						<h3 id="active-investment-strategies" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Active investment strategies</h3>	
						
						<p>In contrast to passive strategies &mdash; which simply recreate a market index &mdash; the portfolio managers of an <strong>active strategy</strong> select a portion of investments from the index that they believe have the best prospects.</p>
						
						<p>Typically, an active strategy will have a set of guidelines in place: the number of holdings to be held in the strategy portfolio, a maximum size of any single holding as a percentage of the total portfolio, requirements for individual holdings (a minimum company size for stocks, or credit rating for bonds), and so on.</p>
						
						<p>Working within the guidelines, portfolio managers use a defined <strong>investment process</strong> to select investments from the index to hold in the strategy portfolio (holdings may vary over time, as conditions change). The guidelines and investment process usually incorporates principles from the managing firm's overall <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-philosophy.asp" target="_blank">investment philosophy</a>.</p>
					
						<h3 id="performance-benchmarks" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Performance benchmarks</h3>	

						<p>For both active and passive strategies, the market index is used as a <strong>benchmark</strong> to periodically compare performance against &mdash;  passive strategies attempt to match the index performance as closely as possible, whereas active strategies attempt to beat it.</p>

							</figcaption>
						</figure>						
											
						<p>The firm's strategies are all actively managed: the firm's portfolio managers build concentrated portfolios of investments which are selected using a value-orientated investment process (all in line with the firm's <a href="business-overview.html#business-overview-for-lewisham-asset-management">overall investment philosophy</a>). Their <strong>Global Equity Strategy</strong>, for example, holds between 30 to 40 stocks in the strategy portolio, selected from roughly 3,000 available in the relevant market index.</p>
						
						<div class="p-4 mb-3 border position-relative">
							<p class="mb-0">List all the investment strategies your firm offers, in a similar format to figure 2. This information should be available internally (the RFP team are a good place to start), in regulatory documents, or within the capabilities or strategies section of the firm's website.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h2 id="investment-vehicles" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Investment vehicles</h2>	
						
						<p>Investment strategies can't be invested in without an associated <strong>investment vehicle</strong> that gives investors something tangible to buy and sell. They allow a strategy to be "put into practice" &mdash; investments (stocks, bonds, or other securities) are selected according to a strategy, held within a vehicle, and actual investment results are delivered to those who invest in the vehicle.</p>
												
						<p>Multiple investment vehicles can be associated with a single strategy, where each vehicle holds the same composition of underlying investments as the representative strategy portfolio (although there may be some slight variation due to customised portfolios or regulatory reasons). If changes are made to holdings within the strategy portfolio, these are usually applied across all investment vehicles associated with the strategy. Occasionally, a portfolio within a vehicle may be divided up into multiple <strong>sleeves</strong>, with each sleeve managed according to a separate strategy.</p>
												
						<p>There are many <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentvehicle.asp" target="_blank">types of investment vehicle</a>, but for our purposes, we will focus on two: <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pooledfunds.asp" target="_blank">pooled funds</a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/separateaccount.asp" target="_blank">separately managed accounts (SMAs)</a>.</p>
											
						<h3 id="pooled-funds" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Pooled funds</h3>
						
						<p>A pooled fund is an investment vehicle in which money is pooled together from multiple investors to hold underlying investments chosen by the fund's investment manager in accordance with an associated investment strategy. Investors can purchase units of a pooled fund to access the associated strategy. Examples of pooled funds include <strong>mutual funds</strong> and <strong>exchange traded funds (ETFs)</strong>.</p>
						
						<p>When making an investment in a pooled fund, investors choose a <strong>share class</strong> from those made available by the fund's investment manager. While all investors in a pooled fund &mdash; no matter which share class they choose &mdash; own the same underlying pool of investments, each share class will offer some form of customisation. A full explanation of each investment manager's share classes are provided in regulatory documents.</p>		
								
						<h4 id="ucits-funds" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">UCITS funds</h4>	
							
						<p>Pooled funds can be launched for investors within a single country (such as the United States), and also &mdash; if they are built with a <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ucits.asp" target="_blank">UCITS</a> structure &mdash; can be marketed and sold in multiple countries (most commonly in the European Union).</p>
						
						<p>To launch UCITS funds, an investment manager must first set up a <strong>fund company</strong> domiciled in a country within the European Union (usually Luxembourg or Ireland, for infrastructure and tax reasons). Once in place, UCITS funds can be launched from within this corporate entity, with each fund known as a <strong>sub-fund</strong> of the fund company.</p>
						
						<p>Making a UCITS sub-fund available for investment requires at least one share class to be created, and each share class must be registered for sale in the domiciled country of the fund company. Once approved, the UCITS framework allows a share class to be freely registered for sale in any other country within the European Union (called <strong>passporting</strong>) or through the usual application process for countries outside the European Union (i.e., no passporting is allowed).</p>
						
						<p>Therefore, the availability of a sub-fund by country is determined at the share class level, and a document is usually maintained by an investment manager's operations team to record which countries each share class is registered for sale (a very helpful resource to ensure UCITS fund-related marketing activity is targeted correctly).</p>
						
						<h4 id="share-class-options" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Share class options</h4>	
						
						<p>In the United States, the only distinction between share classes is the amount of fees and expenses charged to investors. UCITS share classes offer more options, which include:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Fees</strong>. Allows investors with higher sums of money to access lower fees.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Distributions</strong>. Investors who require an income can choose to be paid out distributions from underlying fund investments. Alternatively, income can be retained within the fund and used to generate additional capital growth.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Currencies</strong>. Because UCITS share classes are often available in more than one country, investors may appreciate being able to buy and sell a share class denominated in their local currency.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Currency hedging</strong>. Fund managers attempt to minimise currency risks.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Each UCITS share class typically incorporates a combination of multiple options, with investment managers offering a variety of choices (some have more than 20 share classes available per fund). However, it's unlikely that all possible combinations of options will be made available, and there are no rules that dictate if any UCITS share classes must be made available as a minimum. Presumably, this decision is left to investment managers, who likely create share classes in expectation of client demand (for example, in popular currencies) or when they have been specifically requested (a potential client may request a new share class with a specific set of options).</p>

						<p>Share classes have ongoing running costs, so those with low interest or a low amount of invested capital may be closed by the investment manager.</p>
												
						<p>Importantly, although share classes can't be marketed in countries where they aren't registered for sale, professional investors can actually invest in any UCITS share class they wish &mdash; even those not registered in their country.</p>
						
						<h3 id="separately-managed-accounts" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Separately managed accounts (SMAs)</h3>

						<p>Investors with enough money to invest (this amount is determined by each individual investment manager) can open their own account directly with an investment manager, who buys and sells underlying investments &mdash; according to the associated investment strategy &mdash; within the account.</p>

						<p>This can have some potential advantages when compared to pooled funds:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Direct ownership of underlying investments</strong>. With pooled funds, investors own a share of the investment vehicle, which in turn owns the underlying investments. With an SMA, the investor directly owns the underlying securities.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Customisation</strong>. Unlike pooled funds, which can't be customised beyond the existing share class options, the associated strategy for a separately managed account can be customised for each individual account.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Tax benefits</strong>. As the underlying investments are directly owned by the investor, there may be potential tax benefits by implementing <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxgainlossharvesting.asp" target="_blank">tax-loss harvesting</a> strategies.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Transparency</strong>. More comprehensive and regular reporting for all underlying investments in the portfolio are available.</li>
							<li class="mb-3"><strong>Negotiable fees</strong>. Fees charged by the investment manager can be negotiated by the investor, and may sometimes be lower than actively managed mutual funds.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3 id="fees" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Fees</h3>
						
						<p>The primary source of revenue for investment managers is from the <strong>fees</strong> they charge for managing investment vehicles, usually specified as a percentage of assets and periodically taken out from the capital within the vehicle (occasionally, an additional <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incentive-fee.asp" target="_blank">performance fee</a> is charged). As they are taken out of the vehicle's capital &mdash; and not billed separately to investors &mdash; investment performance of the vehicle is reduced by the amount of the fee each time it is charged.</p>
						
						<p>Fees can vary quite widely across vehicles and share classes, but as a general rule, vehicles with lower fees come with a higher investment minimum requirement.</p>
						
						<h3 id="lewishams-investment-vehicles" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Lewisham's investment vehicles</h3>
						
						<p>Lewisham offer separately managed accounts (available to investors globally), US mutual funds (for US-based investors), and UCITS funds (for investors in a variety of countries within the European Union) &mdash; as shown in figure 3.</p>
						
						<p>Each vehicle is associated with an investment strategy from figure 2.</p>

						<p>Lewisham have domiciled their UCITS fund company in Luxembourg. Therefore, all their UCITS share classes of sub-funds that belong to this fund company were registered in Luxembourg before being passported to other countries as needed. This also means the share class <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isin.asp" target="_blank">ISINs</a> (often used to search for share classes online) all begin with "LU" &mdash; as these first two letters <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/isinnumberingsystem.asp" target="_blank">indicate where the fund company is domiciled</a>.</p>
						
						<div class="p-4 mb-3 border position-relative">
							<p class="mb-0">Locate your firm's registration matrix of UCITS shareclasses &mdash; this is a regularly updated list of all available share classes, including country registration details, in a similar format to figure 7.</p>
						</div>
						
						<p>Investors can also open a separately managed account with Lewisham, using any of the firm's investment strategies as a starting point, which can then be customised for each individual account as needed. The firm has set a minimum investment amount of $25 million, and a (negotiable) fee of 0.50%, in their fee schedule shown in figure 9.</p>
						
						<h3 id="share-class-currencies-and-hedging" class="h5 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Share class currencies &amp; hedging</h3>					
																		
						<p>Lewisham's share classes can be used to demonstrate how share classes priced in different currencies, and currency hedging, can work in practice (note, however, that this section is entirely optional).</p>

						<p>For our example, we will use the <strong>LAM US Equity UCITS Fund</strong>, which is managed using the firm's US Equity strategy and holds underlying investments priced in US Dollars (USD) &mdash; the stocks of US companies. When a UCITS fund's underlying investments are all within a single country, the fund's base currency will typically match the currency of the underlying investments, and so the fund's base currency has also been set to USD.</p>
						
						<h4 id="share-class-currencies" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Share class currencies</h4>	
						
						<p>The first share class launched for the fund (ISIN: <strong>LU1000000001</strong>) is denominated in the same currency as the fund's base currency (USD). The share class net asset value (NAV) is calculated once per day, by dividing the total value of the investments held in the fund by the number of fund units.</p>
						
						<p>Dividing the $100m of fund holdings by 10 million units gives a daily NAV of $10.00: investors can purchase or sell a unit of the fund at this price on that day. The NAV may rise or fall each day: if the fund's investments increase in value to $102 million, and the number of units stay the same, the NAV would change to $10.20 (an increase of 2%).</p>
												
						<p>However, UCITS funds are aimed primarily at investors in the European Union, who will have a different local currency &mdash; such as Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), or Swiss Franc (CHF). Therefore, at some point a currency exchange must occur between the USD share class and the investor's local currency (presumably made by the broker that handled the transaction, who may set a disadvantageous rate for the investor). For example, a UK-based investor's holdings in the fund's USD share class must at some point be converted to GBP.</p>
						
						<p>Investment managers can make it more convenient for investors by offering share classes priced in their local currency (and presumably, they also use a better exchange rate for investors than brokers). Investment performance is also calculated in the relevant currency.</p>
						
						<p>Lewisham offer a share class for the fund with a NAV priced in GBP, for UK investors (ISIN: <strong>LU1000000010</strong>). Roughly speaking, if the USD NAV is $10.00, and the USD/GBP exchange rate is 0.82, the GBP NAV would be roughly £8.20.</p>
						
						<h4 id="currency-hedging" class="h6 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Currency hedging</h4>	
						
						<p>To further complicate matters, currency exchange rates change over time. Therefore, the investment performance of the fund's GBP share class will deviate from the USD share class &mdash; even though they share the same underlying investments.</p>
						
						<p>For example, if the fund's underlying investments rise in value by 2%, the USD NAV would rise by the same amount, as the investments are also priced in USD. But the performance of the GBP share class is also affected by changes in the USD/GBP exchange rate, so if the USD/GBP rate moved from 0.82 to 0.81 during the same period (the GBP weakens in value by 1.22% against the USD) investors in the GBP share class investors would receive a lower return of around 0.76%. </p>
						
						<p>As shown in figure 8, the return of a share class can be split into two components: (1) fund performance in the base currency (e.g., USD), and (2) the change in value of the share class currency versus the fund's base currency, if they are different (e.g., USD/GBP).</p>

								<p class="fw-bold mb-0">Figure 8: Example returns of share class denominated in a different currency</p>
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						
						<p>For investors who are uncomfortable with the currency risk, some investment managers offer <strong>currency hedged</strong> share classes, in which the fund managers attempt to remove the impact of exchange rate changes on the share class return (usually via <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyforward.asp" target="_blank">currency forward contracts</a>). Investors are able to buy and sell the share class in their local currency, but only receive the fund return component: the return of the underlying investments in their base currency. Note, however, that currency hedging is imperfect, and often can't remove 100% of the currency risk, so the performance of a hedged share class may sometimes be slightly affected by exchange rate changes.</p>
						
						<p>Lewisham offer a GBP-hedged share class for the fund (ISIN: <strong>LU1000000012</strong>) in which currency hedging attempts to remove the effect of USD/GBP exchange rate on the share class return so it matches the return of the underlying investments in the fund's base currency &mdash; the same as the USD share class return. Figure 8 includes the return of the GBP-hedged share class, which was only 0.02% off the USD share class for the same period.</p>
							
						<p>Note that more complex examples exist than those we've covered &mdash; funds can hold investments priced in multiple currencies, other types of currency hedging are attempted, and so on &mdash; but they are out of scope for this guide.</p>
						
						<h2 id="model-portfolios" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Model portfolios</h2>		
						
						<p>Some investment managers offer a series of recommended portfolios constructed with pooled funds, called <a href="https://www.broadridge.com/resource/the-rise-of-model-portfolios">model portfolios</a>. They are used by financial advisors to outsource the work of creating and managing their client's portfolios &mdash; including asset allocation, security selection, and rebalancing &mdash; so they can spend more time meeting with and growing their client base.</p>
						
						<p>For each recommended portfolio, an initial asset allocation is set by the investment manager that aims to meet a desired level of risk or income. A relevant pooled fund, usually one managed by the same firm, is assigned for each allocation. As model portfolios tend to span <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp" target="_blank">major asset classes</a>, this means the investment manager will need to have a pooled fund range extensive enough to cover each allocated asset class.</p>
						
						<p>Some investment managers make their model portfolios available as a guide, where subscribers to the service are provided with regaular updates on portfolio allocations and performance, and sent trade updates when any changes to portfolios are made. Others make their model available for investment through advisor investment platform, which use separately managed accounts (SMAs), individually managed accounts (IMAs), and <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uma.asp" target="_blank">unified managed accounts (UMAs)</a> to hold the pooled funds.</p>
						
						<p>Lewisham don't offer model portfolios, but may launch some in the future.</p>
						
						<h2 id="other-services" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">Other services</h2>	

						<p>Some of the larger investment managers offer a small number of services and solutions in addition to the direct management of investment vehicles, including <a class="external" href="https://www.blackrock.com/aladdin" target="_blank">portfolio &amp; risk management software</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_outsourcing">outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO)</a> services, record-keeping for pension plans, <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitieslending.asp" target="_blank">securities lending</a>, and resources to help financial advisors with their <a class="external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/practice-management-4689784" target="_blank">practice management</a>.</p>
						
						<p>Lewisham don't currently offer any additional services.</p>
