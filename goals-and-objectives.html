					<p>When developing a digital marketing strategy, it’s often assumed the first step is to define a big-picture goal and break it down into measurable objectives. This is supposed to give the team direction and help track progress.</p>

					<p>In my view, though, it’s a complete waste of time.</p>

					<p>Coming up with a vague goal might feel like progress &mdash; but it rarely leads to anything useful. And when you try to go further and set measurable objectives, the problems start stacking up.</p>

					<p>Take a typical goal in investment management: grow assets under management (AUM). That’s ultimately achieved by generating inflows into the firm’s products, preventing outflows, and benefiting from any positive market movements. But the data required to link those flows to marketing activity simply doesn’t exist in most firms. Which means the kind of reporting leadership would hypothetically love to see &mdash; marketing-attributed sales, or a clear ROI figure &mdash; just isn’t calculable.</p>

					<p>So instead, teams fall back on setting SMART objectives tied to more accessible marketing KPIs &mdash; leads generated, website traffic, email open rates, and so on. But in reality, these aren’t much better. Most teams don’t use them meaningfully, and there’s good reason for that.</p>

					<p>There are two main problems:</p>

					<ol>
						<li><strong>The objectives themselves are weak</strong>. They’re usually chosen arbitrarily, can’t account for nuance (like lead quality or the intent behind a website visit), and rarely influence decision-making. They feel more like box-ticking than strategy.</li>
						<li><strong>The data is fragmented and hard to access</strong>. It’s spread across multiple platforms and systems. Pulling it together takes time, money, and tools that many teams don’t have. The few attempts I’ve seen to regularly set and review SMART objectives inevitably run out of steam.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Even when KPI dashboards do get built, there’s an implicit belief that someone in the business is actively tracking them. But that person usually doesn’t exist. Sure, questions from colleagues come up from time to time, but these are almost always better handled via a quick analysis or self-serve report &mdash; not by maintaining a comprehensive set of KPIs "just in case."</p>

<h2 id="a-better-use-of-time" class="h4 border-bottom pt-3 pb-3 mb-3">A Better Use of Time</h2>

					<p>Instead of agonising over goals and objectives, I recommend focusing on how you actually work day to day.</p>

					<p>Cal Newport’s book Slow Productivity offers a compelling framework for this:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Do fewer things</li>
						<li>Work at a natural pace</li>
						<li>Obsess over quality</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Yes, this might sound idealistic &mdash; especially in a large organisation. But it’s a powerful mindset shift. It leads to deeper satisfaction, better work, and long-term success without the constant busyness that burns people out.</p>
					
					<p>The approach outlined in this guide aims to support exactly that. The initial setup of your digital marketing infrastructure is deliberately structured as a sequence of steps, each building on the last. This helps ensure focus, avoids distractions, and gives each task the attention it deserves.</p>

					<p>Once the setup is complete, much of the day-to-day activity is automated within a coherent framework. That means your time is freed up to properly consider new tasks, projects, and experiments &mdash; and make better decisions about what to do next. Not unlike Warren Buffett, who famously spends most of his time thinking, not doing.</p>
